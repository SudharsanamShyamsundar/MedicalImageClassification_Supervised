This is the Multi Class Image Classification Model



Title : Multi class Image Classifcation for Traffic Sign - for Two different Nations (German and Persian)


Problem Statement 

Training the Model with Two different datasets which are available on Kaggle for  Traffic Sign:

There are 43 classes each for German and Persian datasets, Here I have taken few classes from both the datasets and combined it. 

Class list :
0 : No passing veh over 3.5 tons
1 : Right-of-way at intersection
2 :Priority road
3:Veh > 3.5 tons prohibited
4:General caution
5:Dangerous curve left
6:Dangerous curve right
7:Double curve
8:Bumpy road
9:Slippery road
10:Road narrows on the right
11:End no passing veh > 3.5 tons
12:Cycle crossing
13:Give Way',
14:Hump
15:Left Turn Prohibited
16:MotorCycle Prohibited
17:Park Forbidden
18:Speed Camera
19:Road Work
20:School Crossing


As classes have been given different id as a result of taking random classes from datsets, Test dataset has to be corrected and doing it in using Python Script 

Learning Outcome : To implement the computer vision and CNN techniques for the Image classification which have been learned during the semester 

Datesets used:
1. German Traffic Sign Recognition
2. Persian Traffic Sign Recognition

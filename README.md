Project Description
Given the image , the model has to predict which class these image belongs to . 
We have taken German and Persian(Iran) Traffic Sign Datasets from the kaggle which will be used for training the model.
Proposal is to train the model with the following approach 
    1. Use German Traffic Sign Dataset
    2. Use Persian Traffic Sign Dataset
    3. Combine the Persian and Traffic Sign Dataset 

For your awareness , as lot of solutions has been made in Kaggle for training only the German Traffic Sign dataset, we have taken 
the Persian(Iran) traffic Sign dataset and doing the custom training by experimenting with different activations functions ,CNN 
techniques ,epochs for the good learning outcome of the deep learning fundamentals course .

In addition , we would like to include the image enhancment techniques ,if possible.

Categories in German and persian datasets, both these datasets share the same 43 class types.

Datesets used:
1. German Traffic Sign Recognition
2. Persian Traffic Sign Recognition
